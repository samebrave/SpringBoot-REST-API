# Spring Boot Simple REST API

This project serves as a starting point for creating a simple REST API using Spring Boot. The API supports basic @GET requests and has been developed without using a database, yet. Checks were done by Postman.

## Technologies

- **Spring Boot**: A Java-based framework for rapid application development.
- **Lombok**: A library used to reduce boilerplate code in Java.
- **Spring Web**: Components necessary for building RESTful web services.

## Project Structure

- **Controller**: Classes that handle HTTP requests.
- **Service**: Classes that contain business logic.
- **Repository**: Data access layer (a simple structure is used in this project since no database is involved).

## Installation
